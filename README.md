# Multiple Linear Regression Project
This project showcases the implementation of multiple linear regression in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Multiple linear regression is a vital machine learning algorithm employed to predict a numerical target variable based on multiple input features.

## Overview
In this project, we will:
Explore a dataset.
Preprocess the data.
Implement multiple linear regression.
Evaluate the model.
Make predictions.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
Jupyter Notebook
You can install them using pip:

```bash

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
```
## Usage

Step 1: Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmad1015/Multiple-Linear-Regression.git
cd Multiple-Linear-Regression
```
Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook.
Step 2: Open the multiple_linear_regression.ipynb.ipynb notebook.
step3: Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to comprehend and implement multiple linear regression.
